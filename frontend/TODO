Possible bug:
Let mushroom A have minimum weight 4.000 and tolerance 0.050,
mushroom B have minimum weight 5.000 and tolerance 0.100.
If the operator records a box with final weight 4.030 of type
mushroom A and then edit the history changing the type of the
box to a type B, then type B will be invalid (i.e. it will be
underweight).
We might need to add more checking in the editing otherwise
some boxes might have its records corrupted.
