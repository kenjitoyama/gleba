Gleba is an open source automated weighing system.

Gleba was originally written by Simon Dawson, Meryl Baquiran, Chris Ellis
and Daniel Kenji Toyama for Barrett's Mushrooms.

Dependencies:
Python 2.7 (http://www.python.org/)
Django 1.3+ (http://www.djangoproject.com/)
Gnuplot.py 1.8+ (http://gnuplot-py.sourceforge.net/)
Socat 1.7.1.3+ (http://www.dest-unreach.org/socat/) (for testing only)
PySerial 2.5+ (http://pyserial.sourceforge.net/)
PyGTK 2.22+ (http://www.pygtk.org/)

The testing suite is written only for POSIX (because of its dependency
on socat), but there are plans to support it in Windows too.

TODO:

There's a bunch of things to do at the moment, I'm in the process of
cleaning up the code. Patches are welcome though.
