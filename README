Gleba is an open source automated weighing system. It allows you to record
boxes with an associated content to a database, and then extract some
statistics and reports.

Gleba was designed to automate the tedious task of weighing boxes in a
farm. The boxes were required to have a minimum weight depending on the
variety/content of these boxes. Each box also had an associated picker
that represented the person that had collected the contents of such box.
The goal was to make the weighing as fast and accurate as possible using
touchscreen devices so that operators did not have to use the mouse or the
keyboard while manipulating heavy boxes.

Please check the wiki page for installation and usage instructions.

Gleba was originally written by Simon Dawson, Meryl Baquiran, Chris Ellis
and Daniel Kenji Toyama for Barrett's Mushrooms. It's licensed under the
